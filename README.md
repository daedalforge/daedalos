# DaedalOS

A custom operating system built from the ground up using [Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/).

## Overview

DaedalOS is a Linux-based operating system assembled from source code, following the Linux From Scratch methodology. Every package is compiled and configured by hand, providing complete control over the system and a deep understanding of how a Linux OS works from the kernel up.

## Goals

- Build a minimal, reproducible Linux system entirely from source
- Maintain full control over every component in the toolchain
- Document each build step for transparency and reproducibility
- Create a lightweight, purpose-built operating system

## Prerequisites

- A Linux host system with a working compiler toolchain
- At least 10 GB of free disk space
- Basic knowledge of shell scripting and package compilation
- Refer to [LFS host system requirements](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter02/hostreqs.html) for details
